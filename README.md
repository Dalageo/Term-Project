# Term Project - Calibration using AI

# Abstract
This project aims at enhancing sensor data calibration through machine learning (ML) models, using the Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset with 13,910 readings from sensors exposed to six gases over 36 months. By analyzing these sensor data, it develops Decision Tree and Random Forest models to accurately interpret sensor outputs. The Decision Tree model involves fine-tuning various hyperparameters, while the Random Forest model reduces overfitting by averaging multiple decision trees predictions, proving more effective in handling complex sensor drift data. It highlights the importance of advanced, regularly updated machine learning techniques for precise sensor calibration and suggests future enhancements for better accuracy

# Data Description
The dataset utilized in this project is the "Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset at Different Concentrations" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 13,910 measurements from 16 chemical sensors exposed to six different gases (Ammonia, Acetaldehyde, Acetone, Ethylene, Ethanol, and Toluene) at various concentration levels (5-1000 ppmv). The dataset is collected over a period of 36 months (January 2008 to February 2011) in a gas delivery platform facility situated at the ChemoSignals Laboratory in the BioCircuits Institute, University of California San Diego. Each reading is represented by a set of 128 features, which include information of the maximum resistance change to different gases and how the sensor's response varies over time
