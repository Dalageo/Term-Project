# Term Project - Calibration using AI

# Abstract
This project explores the application of machine learning (ML) to improve the calibration of sensor data, utilizing the Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset which comprises 13,910 readings from sensors exposed to six gases over 36 months. The study focuses on developing a Decision Tree and a Random Forest model to accurately interpret sensor outputs. These models are fine-tuned through an array of hyperparameters and assessed across various figures of merit. This study highlights the importance of advanced, regularly updated machine learning techniques for precise sensor calibration and suggests avenues for future enhancements to further improve accuracy.

# Data Description
The dataset utilized in this project is the "Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset at Different Concentrations" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 13,910 measurements from 16 chemical sensors exposed to six different gases (Ammonia, Acetaldehyde, Acetone, Ethylene, Ethanol, and Toluene) at various concentration levels (5-1000 ppmv). The dataset is collected over a period of 36 months (January 2008 to February 2011) in a gas delivery platform facility situated at the ChemoSignals Laboratory in the BioCircuits Institute, University of California San Diego. Each reading is represented by a set of 128 features, which include information of the maximum resistance change to different gases and how the sensor's response varies over time
